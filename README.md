# Python-Bike-Share-Analysis
Imagine you’re the lead analyst for a bike-sharing service based in New York City, USA. Your team has been tasked with analyzing user behavior to help the business strategy department assess the current logistics model of bike distribution across the city and identify expansion opportunities.

## Objective

The project’s objective is to conduct a descriptive analysis of existing data and discover actionable insights for the business strategy team to help make informed decisions that will circumvent availability issues and ensure the company’s position as a leader in eco-friendly transportation solutions in the city. 

## Key Questions

- What are the most popular stations in the city?
- Which are the months with the most trips taken? Is there a weather component at play?
- What are the most popular trips between stations?
- Are the existing stations evenly distributed?
- What time of day are the most trips taken?
- Do member riders bike to and from the same stations; Do casual riders tend to take a one-way trip?
- How does weather effect rides? During what temperatures are the least/most rides taken?
